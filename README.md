# Measuring-impact-of-Nepal-2015-Earthquake
This is a Machine learning course project focusing on measuring impact of Nepal 2105 earthquake on various attributes of information flow using Twitter data. This project is in conjuction with the United Nations Guiding Principles
We examine tweets relating to the Nepal Earthquake of 2015 to determine whether there are observable behavioral changes before and after the earthquake. Next, we attempt to find correlations between volumetric changes and measures of impact of the earthquake on different areas. Finally, we assess the feasibility of using behavioral proxies to compare and model recovery and resilience timelines. We also propose a methodology to assign geo-located tweets to bins based on fixed-intervals of radii, and identify stronger measures of impact that are associated with volumetric changes.
